###Run locally

To visualize the project, during the development, we suggest to use a **web server**. 

http-server is a **NodeJS** command and you need to download this platform from the official web site: [NodeJS]( http://nodejs.org/).

http://nodejs.org/
 
  
Launch the **Terminal** programm in the folder of the project and write this command:

    npm install 
    
    sudo npm install -g http-server 
    
Runn this command **only the first time** when you need to install the web server. For this operation is request the password of system.

After this you can write the command to launch the **web server**:

    http-server
 

This default configuration run an HTTP Server available at:

    http://localhost:8080
