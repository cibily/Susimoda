###How to run locally

To visualize the project, during the development, we suggest to use a **web server**.  
Launch the **Terminal** programm in the folder of the project and write this command:

    sudo npm install -g http-server 
    
Runn this command **only the first time** when you need to install the web server. For this operation is request the password of system.

After this you can write the command to launch the **web server**:

    http-server
 

This default configuration run an HTTP Server available at:

    http://localhost:8080


I can read the complete **tutorial** on: [Movebleapp.com](http://movableapp.com/2014/03/quick-nodejs-http-server/)


###How to add issues 

A stackeholder can write issues on GitHub web site to report a problem or bug.
Every issue have a ID number preceded by the symbol **#**.
